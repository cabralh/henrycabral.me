        Recently, I have started to collect and restore vintage keyboards.
        Initially, I was primarily interested in IBM boards due to their
        reputation, but folks on Deskthority educated me on the vast universe
        of many forgotten keyboards.

        After owning more than a few keyboards, I have documented some of them
        here.
