        Like many many nerds out there, I also worship the rectangles I type on
        every day. Recently I have started to collect and restore vintage
        keyboards, especially the IBM ones.

        On this page, I have tried to document all the keyboards I currently
        have. The restoration and other related articles go to the
        <a href="/posts">posts</a> page.
