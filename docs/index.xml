      <description>History This keyboard originally came with IBM Personal Computer AT (PC/AT). This computer was released in 1984, and IBM has produced over 100,000 units before discontinuing them in 1987. Some sources say that the AT stands for Advanced Technology.
IBM Model F AT key units   This model was a successor to the very famous and now weird XT layout. The IBM PS/2 (Personal System/2) was the successor to the IBM PC/AT, and with it came the venerable model M keyboard.</description>

      <description>At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.
The board wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a terrible condition when I got it. The foam had turned into sticky goo, which needed some cleaning up. I manually cut a craft store foam and replaced it.</description>

      <description>This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and care, it was up and running in a few hours.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.</description>

General configuration We need to create a ~/.tmux.conf file in our home directory. This will be the configuration file for our setup.
If the underlying terminal emulator has XTERM-256 support then we can add 256 colors support to tmux.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents   So what went wrong?    My new workflow    Conclusion      So I have been using Gatsby for almost two years now.

With Gatsby I got PWA is out of the box, the component&amp;rsquo;s are written in react, I can query my post data from graphQL and so many other goodies.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents   The GitHub OAuth process    Why do we need a back-end server    The proxy    Conclusion      Recently I was building a GitHub OAuth app to authentiacate one my client-side application with GitHub. The application was all about taking notes and maintaining them on a private repository. I have had worked on such an architecture in one of my previous jobs where we have used AWS CodeCommit  as an inventory of resources where the history and the changes were easier to maintain.</description>

      <description>I have heard it many times and I have had enough.
Some devs(mostly junior) come up to me and ask what to build as a side project and my answer always has been is to build something that you see everyday and improve if possible. Then the next thing I get is &amp;ldquo;I wanna build that but it already exists&amp;rdquo; or something like &amp;ldquo;Even if I build it I can&amp;rsquo;t show it on my resume because there is a better alternative.</description>

      <description>I have spend enormous time on configuring and reconfiguring my vimrc file for the past 4 years. I have been using (neo)vim at work for last 2 years and I am really happy how this has turned out. Now I am pretty confident on most of the vim key-bindings, the register management and a lot of other amazing features.
Fuck it! I am switching to Emacs.

      <description>Table of Contents   Let&amp;rsquo;s go hacking    Not quite there yet!    Gimme the code!      In this post I am going to plug about a cool trick(probably useless) that I discovered geeking around the internet.
I was building a tiny microservice  which would let the client side application securely authenticate with GitHub. After writing the only required API, I wanted to render the README.</description>

2020 huh. Well as usual I don&amp;rsquo;t have a resolution this year. My resolution deadlines are quite small and always ends with utter disappointment, so I better not mention it here.(recruiters ignore this)
 Let&amp;rsquo;s get serious!
 New project In January, I started working on a project named Solitude.</description>

      <description>I have been spending so much time and energy tweaking this website, that I feel like I should maintain a log for it. No Git commit messages are not enough anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s kinda fun owning a place on the internet but at the same time it should at least mean something.
This update brings a list of logs where I will be writing more often now. Logs will be mostly unimportant and personal(Not that personal).</description>

As most of the today&amp;rsquo;s servers are hosted on linux machines, setting a cron job for periodic task might seem like a good option for many. However in production having a crontab is nothing but a pain in the a**.</description>

      <description>I love working in terminal and editing with (Neo)vim  . Though I have been using vim since my college days, for past two years I am using it as my full-time editor.
I remember vividly when I first switched to vim at work. It was a horrible experience for the first week which made me flood my vimrc file with plugins to make it work. I have definitely moved past that phase and learned to grok  vi since then.</description>

      <description>Flask is one of the most used python frameworks for web development. Its simplicity and extensibility makes it convenient for both small and large applications alike.
In this blog we are going to create a simple flask web application that will generate and serve files without storing them in the server.
 Note: For flask and python installation visit flask documentation   Let&amp;rsquo;s create a flask application with a basic route.</description>

Initially it was incredibly tough to adopt and use it in work. Well that would be another story to tell.
Back then I was working mostly in backend using CoffeeScript  (I know 🙈).</description>

      <description>I recently left a huge IT corporation for a promising startup.I was asked to change my GitHub handler name as it was too cool(I think) for them.Well instead of changing I created another account using my company email.
Now I got a problem.Every day when I come home and start hacking around my own projects I had to manually set my username and email id in git config in order to reflect my contributions in the graph and most of the time I forget to do so.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents   Using Proxy with NPM      For people who work in a company and squeez out some of their time to learn nodejs, setting up an dev-environment can be a real pain. Proxy servers are pretty common in college and business type institutions.
You can locate your proxy settings from your browser&amp;rsquo;s settings panel.
Using Proxy with NPM Once you have obtained the proxy settings (server URL, port, username and password); you need to configure your npm configurations as follows.</description>
