      <description>So here I am, finally acknowledging an issue I am both suffering from and enjoying. I own around 50 keyboards, most of them are vintage, and some of them are modified to be used with modern computers. I am not a collector, nor aspiring to be one. I have no reason to buy so many of them. I might be suffering from Compulsive Buying Disorder, and the only time I stop is when I run out of money.</description>

New hobbies I started collecting vintage keyboards during the early months of last year. I initially started with IBM boards due to my love for clicky switches. Then after a while, I learned about hundreds of varieties of switches that were manufactured in the last century, and obviously, I have started to collect them.</description>

      <description>At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.
Initially, I liked the battered look of the board, but after a while, I powder coated it to black. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find an &amp;ldquo;olive-green&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;matte-black&amp;rdquo; color, So I settled for Glossy black.</description>

      <guid>https://rudra.dev/keyboards/ibm_model_f_5150_xt/</guid>
      <description>This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and care, it was up and running in a few hours.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.</description>

Some devs(mostly junior) come up to me and ask what to build as a side project and my answer always has been is to build something that you see everyday and improve if possible. Then the next thing I get is &amp;ldquo;I wanna build that but it already exists&amp;rdquo; or something like &amp;ldquo;Even if I build it I can&amp;rsquo;t show it on my resume because there is a better alternative.</description>

      <description>I love working in terminal and editing with (Neo)vim  . Though I have been using vim since my college days, for past two years I am using it as my full-time editor.
I remember vividly when I first switched to vim at work. It was a horrible experience for the first week which made me flood my vimrc file with plugins to make it work. I have definitely moved past that phase and learned to grok  vi since then.</description>

      <description>Flask is one of the most used python frameworks for web development. Its simplicity and extensibility makes it convenient for both small and large applications alike.
In this blog we are going to create a simple flask web application that will generate and serve files without storing them in the server.
 Note: For flask and python installation visit flask documentation   Let&amp;rsquo;s create a flask application with a basic route.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents   Syntax Highlighting    Linters and Formatters    Autocompletion    Commenting    Conclusion      It&amp;rsquo;s been 8 months since I have been using (neo)vim as my primary text editor. Initially it was incredibly tough to adopt and use it in work. Well that would be another story to tell.
Back then I was working mostly in backend using CoffeeScript  (I know 🙈).</description>

      <description>I recently left a huge IT corporation for a promising startup.I was asked to change my GitHub handler name as it was too cool(I think) for them.Well instead of changing I created another account using my company email.
Now I got a problem.Every day when I come home and start hacking around my own projects I had to manually set my username and email id in git config in order to reflect my contributions in the graph and most of the time I forget to do so.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents   Using Proxy with NPM      For people who work in a company and squeez out some of their time to learn nodejs, setting up an dev-environment can be a real pain. Proxy servers are pretty common in college and business type institutions.
