I have built a nice looking and fast blog with 15 odd posts. With Gatsby I got PWA is out of the box, the component&amp;rsquo;s are written in react, I can query my post data from graphQL and so many other goodies.
So why am I moving away you ask? As with my career decisions I have gradually moved from being a Full-stack(UI Primary) engineer to a back-end/platform engineer.</description></item><item><title>Setting up (Neo)vim for React development</title><link>https://rudra.dev/posts/setting-up-vim-for-react/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 May 2019 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://rudra.dev/posts/setting-up-vim-for-react/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 8 months since I have been using (neo)vim as my primary text editor. Initially it was incredibly tough to adopt and use it in work. Well that would be another story to tell.
Back then I was working mostly in backend using CoffeeScript (I know ðŸ™ˆ). VS Code had a little support for CoffeeScript so I didn&amp;rsquo;t had any problems using vim full time.
But things changed drastically when I moved into UI development this year.</description></item></channel></rss>
