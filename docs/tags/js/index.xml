      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been 8 months since I have been using (neo)vim as my primary text editor. Initially it was incredibly tough to adopt and use it in work. Well that would be another story to tell.
Back then I was working mostly in backend using CoffeeScript (I know ðŸ™ˆ). VS Code had a little support for CoffeeScript so I didn&amp;rsquo;t had any problems using vim full time.
But things changed drastically when I moved into UI development this year.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This post literally doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted to delete it as it was my first blog.
 The earliest computers were often programmed without the help of a programming language, by writing programs in absolute machine language. The programs, in decimal or binary form (mostly binary),were read in from punched cards or magnetic tape or toggled in on switches on the front panel of the computer.</description>
