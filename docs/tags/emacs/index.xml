      <description>So I have been using Gatsby for almost two years now. I have built a nice looking and fast blog with 15 odd posts. With Gatsby I got PWA is out of the box, the component&amp;rsquo;s are written in react, I can query my post data from graphQL and so many other goodies.
So why am I moving away you ask? As with my career decisions I have gradually moved from being a Full-stack(UI Primary) engineer to a back-end/platform engineer.</description>

      <description>I have spend enormous time on configuring and reconfiguring my vimrc file for the past 4 years. I have been using (neo)vim at work for last 2 years and I am really happy how this has turned out. Now I am pretty confident on most of the vim key-bindings, the register management and a lot of other amazing features.
Fuck it! I am switching to Emacs.
