Acer 6312-k back PCB  Build and Features I have acquired this New old stock keyboard from eBay for a very reasonable price. The keyboard isn’t too heavy despite its large footprint. However, the board is built very well and doesn’t creak, unlike other cheap boards.</description>

      <description>This board was manufactured by a Czechoslovakian company called Zbrojovka Brno  in the late &amp;rsquo;80s. Zbrojovka Brno manufactured small arms, motor vehicles, and later typewriters and computers.
I have documented another Zbrojokva board,  and it&amp;rsquo;s very similar to that one.
Zbrojovka Brno 262.4 back   Acquisition My good friend krikun98  , helped me buy and ship a few Soviet-era boards along with this one. This board is in NOS condition, So I didn&amp;rsquo;t open it up to take some pictures.</description>

      <description>At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.
Initially, I liked the battered look of the board, but after a while, I powder coated it to black. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find an &amp;ldquo;olive-green&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;matte-black&amp;rdquo; color, So I settled for Glossy black.</description>

      <guid>https://rudra.dev/keyboards/ibm_model_f_5150_xt/</guid>
      <description>This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and care, it was up and running in a few hours.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.</description>
