      <description>History This keyboard was manufactured by NMB  in the early &amp;rsquo;90s for Televideo terminals. This particular board was made for the Televideo 99X series of terminals. This layout is known as DEC layout, named after Digital Equipment Corporation  and uses a different protocol to communicate with the Terminals.
Acquisition I was lucky enough to get into the largest vintage computer keyboard  group-buy in history. Inoznez  , used his parent&amp;rsquo;s farm to store the boards and slowly shipped them out all over the world.</description>
