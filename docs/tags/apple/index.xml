      <description>History Apple manufactured this board in the late &amp;rsquo;80s and early 90s. This board was the successor of the venerable Apple Extended Keyboard. These boards were included with Apple professional desktops starting with the Macintosh IIsi  .
These boards use either Alps or Mitsumi switches. The Mitsumi switches were only used on boards made in Japan. M3501s are said to be the last &amp;ldquo;Mechanical Keyboards&amp;rdquo; that apple has ever made.</description>
