      <description>I love working in terminal and editing with (Neo)vim . Though I have been using vim since my college days, for past two years I am using it as my full-time editor.
I remember vividly when I first switched to vim at work. It was a horrible experience for the first week which made me flood my vimrc file with plugins to make it work. I have definitely moved past that phase and learned to grok vi since then.</description>
