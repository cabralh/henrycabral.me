      <description>History Apple manufactured this board in the late &amp;rsquo;80s and early 90s. This board was the successor of the venerable Apple Extended Keyboard. These boards were included with Apple professional desktops starting with the Macintosh IIsi  .
These boards use either Alps or Mitsumi switches. The Mitsumi switches were only used on boards made in Japan. M3501s are said to be the last &amp;ldquo;Mechanical Keyboards&amp;rdquo; that apple has ever made.</description>

      <description>History This board was manufactured by a Czechoslovakian company called Zbrojovka Brno  in the late &amp;rsquo;80s. Zbrojovka Brno manufactured small arms, motor vehicles, and later typewriters and computers.

Zbrojovka Brno 265.6 back   Acquisition &amp;amp; Restoration It had been up for sale for more than a year on r/mechmarket  , and I was lucky enough to snag it for a very fair price.</description>

      <description>History This keyboard originally came with IBM Personal Computer AT (PC/AT). This computer was released in 1984, and IBM has produced over 100,000 units before discontinuing them in 1987. Some sources say that the AT stands for Advanced Technology.
IBM Model F AT key units   This model was a successor to the very famous and now weird XT layout. The IBM PS/2 (Personal System/2) was the successor to the IBM PC/AT, and with it came the venerable model M keyboard.</description>

      <description>At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.
Initially, I liked the battered look of the board, but after a while, I powder coated it to black. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find an &amp;ldquo;olive-green&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;matte-black&amp;rdquo; color, So I settled for Glossy black.</description>

      <description>This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and care, it was up and running in a few hours.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.</description>

      <guid>https://rudra.dev/collections/ibm_f62_reproduction/</guid>
      <description>History This keyboard is a reproduction of one of the original IBM model F 4704 series keyboards. Originally it came with the IBM 4704 FINANCE COMMUNICATION DISPLAY STATION MODEL 1 ENHANCED and mainly used by the banking industry. In 2012, it was first documented by a Canadian computer enthusiast who goes by the name Kishy  and hence called the Kishsaver.
In 2015, Joe Strandberg aka Ellipse has decided to make reproductions  of the F62 and F77 models.</description>
