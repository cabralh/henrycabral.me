      <description>I have heard it many times and I have had enough.
Some devs(mostly junior) come up to me and ask what to build as a side project and my answer always has been is to build something that you see everyday and improve if possible. Then the next thing I get is &amp;ldquo;I wanna build that but it already exists&amp;rdquo; or something like &amp;ldquo;Even if I build it I can&amp;rsquo;t show it on my resume because there is a better alternative.</description>

      <description>I have spend enormous time on configuring and reconfiguring my vimrc file for the past 4 years. I have been using (neo)vim at work for last 2 years and I am really happy how this has turned out. Now I am pretty confident on most of the vim key-bindings, the register management and a lot of other amazing features.
Fuck it! I am switching to Emacs.

      <description>Guess it&amp;rsquo;s time for a status update.
2020 huh. Well as usual I don&amp;rsquo;t have a resolution this year. My resolution deadlines are quite small and always ends with utter disappointment, so I better not mention it here.(recruiters ignore this)
 Let&amp;rsquo;s get serious!
 New project In January, I started working on a project named Solitude. It&amp;rsquo;s a note taking application which is using GitHub as a CMS. It will create and maintain a repository of notes and will sync them in real-time.</description>

      <description>Guess it&amp;rsquo;s time to retrospect the last 12 months.
I will be talking about topics that I have worked on or learned. These are listed in no particular order.
Python In June I switched my job and accepted a position of a back-end developer in a fairly new company with a brand new project. The tech stack was python and angular. Even though Python was my first love, by that time I was more of a JavaScript guy rather than a Pythonista.</description>

      <description>I have been spending so much time and energy tweaking this website, that I feel like I should maintain a log for it. No Git commit messages are not enough anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s kinda fun owning a place on the internet but at the same time it should at least mean something.
This update brings a list of logs where I will be writing more often now. Logs will be mostly unimportant and personal(Not that personal).</description>
