				<p>Guess it&rsquo;s time to retrospect the last 12 months.</p>
<p>I will be talking about topics that I have worked on or learned. These
are listed in no particular order.</p>
<h2 id="python"><strong>Python</strong></h2>
<p>In June I switched my job and accepted a position of a back-end
developer in a fairly new company with a brand new project. The tech
stack was python and angular. Even though Python was my first love, by
that time I was more of a JavaScript guy rather than a Pythonista.
Luckily I got more than enough support from my team to understand the
implemented code base and in no time I was comfortable enough finish
several Jira tasks.</p>
<p>I have learned Flask as it is the <em>de facto</em> framework for all the
projects we have been building here. I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice how
similar it was to express.js, which in fact helped me accelerating my
learning.</p>
<p>Python is so straight forward and fun, sometimes I wonder why I left it
in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="react"><strong>React</strong></h2>
<p>Even though I have been building React applications for more than two
years, This year, particularly the first half in
<a href="https://turbot.com" target="_blank">Turbot</a>
 I got an opportunity to build/contribute
to a project which helped me understand the design patterns around a
front-end application, code-splitting, authorization, authentication and
much more.</p>
<h2 id="touch-typing"><strong>Touch typing</strong></h2>
<p>This is something I am actually proud of.</p>
<p>Fortunately I was able to get a job that respects the work life balance
everybody should have. Ironically given the fact that I had little
difference between work and my life(my cat sighs ðŸ˜¾!), I chose to develop
some nerd powers that I have been dreaming to have for a long time.I
have always wanted to learn touch typing since I saw one of my
ex-colleague writing code at 80wpm.</p>
<p>I never actually got time to practice/focus on it until after June, when
I changed my job and joined the above mentioned company. The project was
in its infancy and all I had to do is write code without looking down at
my keyboard. I will admit, it was really tough to break an ancient
practice of peeking and typing until I replaced my keyboard keycaps with
blank ones.</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://10fastfingers.com/" target="_blank">10fastfingers.com</a>
 and
<a href="https://www.typingclub.com/" target="_blank">typingclub</a>
 were a great help in
practicing too.</p>
<h2 id="vi"><strong>vi</strong></h2>
<p>This year was monumental for my personal vim experience.</p>
<p>My vim configuration got much matured. Coupling with touch-typing I
almost felt like a Wizard I always wanted to be. I even wrote some posts
on customizing vim for different purposes too.</p>
<p>Pretty good huh!</p>
<h2 id="epilogue"><strong>epilogue</strong></h2>
<p>Honestly it was a pretty good year for me. A new job, new city and a
bunch of cool stuff to learn!</p>

<p>Hope Loki approves this post.</p>
<p>He got me this year too.</p>
