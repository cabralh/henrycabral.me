# Personal blog/portfolio

## Technologies Used:
- [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [ox-Hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Notes:
- Original org files can be found at `content-org` folder and the generated md files are in `content`.

## Development
How to Start 

Quick and easy install.

1. **Install Hugo**

For my Mac, I used Homebrew:

  ```
  brew install hugo
  ```

For all other operating systems, click [here](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

2. **Fork Repository**

At the top of this window, make sure to fork this repository. Once forked, open the repository locally by running:

  ```
  git clone *repository*
  ```

3. **Run Yarn Install**

  ```
  Yarn install
  ```

4. **Run Hugo server**

  ```
  make run
  ```

## Production
I host my website on Netlify which is simple to use. When hosting on Netlify, it will link your Github repository to Netlify. Every commit is saved and the website is rebuilt. Ensure the following command is listed within Netlify to build your files.

  ```
  make build
  ```

## Project structure

- content-org/ : .ORG files for each sub-route, (e.g logs, posts, etc.)
- content/ : Markdown files generated by ox-hugo.
- docs/ : Static files to host from Github.
- themes/ : Flamingo theme.
- static/ : Pictures, icons, thumbnails, etc.
