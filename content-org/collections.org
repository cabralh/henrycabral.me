This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken
into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and
care, it was up and running in a few hours.

I don't know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker
that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured
before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.

I got a Soarer's converter along with this keyboard. With a bit of remapping, I
was able to replace it with my Drop CTRL as my new daily driver.

At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have
acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were
kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.

Initially, I liked the battered look of the board, but after a while, I powder
coated it to black. I couldn't find an "olive-green" or "matte-black" color,
So I settled for Glossy black. It looked quite good in person but shines a lot
on camera.

The board wasn't in a terrible condition when I got it. The foam had turned
into sticky goo, which needed some cleaning up. I manually cut a craft store
foam and replaced it.

I got [[https://github.com/purdeaandrei/CompactBeamSpring][Pandrew's version of the Xwhatsit controller]] to replace the original
controller. I got Pandrew's solenoid driver too, and after a bit of hacking
around with QMK, I got it working.

There are some corrosions on the plate but I was told that they won't grow, so
I didn't bother. There was a bit of rust on the switch springs, so I tried to
take apart the switches to clean them but found them hard to disassemble and
ultimately gave up. The rust doesn't affect the smoothness of the switches.

I used the board for a week as my daily driver with the solenoid on. I wasn't
very impressed with the heavy space bar as it tired my thumb after every 15
minutes. Apart from that, this board is an absolute joy to have and is
a thing of beauty.

I love this board, and hopefully, it will be on my secondary machine for years
to come, but right now, I will get back to my beloved [[/collections/ibm_model_f_at/][F AT]] and get some work
done.

*** History
This keyboard originally came with IBM Personal Computer AT (PC/AT). This
computer was released in 1984, and IBM has produced over 100,000 units before
discontinuing them in 1987. Some sources say that the *AT* stands for *Advanced Technology*.

    <span class="img-description"> IBM Model F AT key units </span>
  </div>
#+END_EXPORT

This model was a successor to the very famous and now weird XT layout. The IBM PS/2 (Personal System/2) was the successor to the IBM PC/AT, and with it came the venerable model M keyboard. The model M keyboard introduced the very layout that is being used worldwide even today.

*** Acquisition & Restoration

I have acquired this keyboard from eBay for a fair price. It was super dirty and was full of gunk. The barrel plate has rusty, and there were a bunch of dead spiders inside. The keycaps were quite filthy too.

The Foam was rotten and kept falling out the whole time. However, the back rainbow plate was pristine, and there weren't any rust spots on it.

  </div>
#+END_EXPORT

I removed the caps and barrels and washed them in warm soapy water. Then scrubbed the barrel plate but couldn't repaint it because I ran out of spray paints by then. Replaced the rotten foam with a hand-made 2mm one, and reassembled everything.

#+END_EXPORT

It was an absolute joy to use the keyboard on modern machines. It uses AT protocol, So using a passive AT to PS/2 converter would do the trick. Since I don't own a computer with a native PS/2 port, I daisy-chained an active PS/2 to USB (A) converter and then another Type A to Type C adapter to connect my Macbook Pro.

*** History


This board was manufactured by a Czechoslovakian company called [[http://www.zbrojovka-brno.cz/][Zbrojovka Brno]]
in the late '80s. Zbrojovka Brno manufactured small arms, motor vehicles, and
later typewriters and computers.

This board was made in 1988, and it uses the Soviet-era [[https://www.tesla.cz/en/][Tesla]] hall effect
switches.

*** Acquisition & Restoration

It had been up for sale for more than a year on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/][r/mechmarket]], and I was lucky
enough to snag it for a very fair price.  It took exactly a month to reach
India from Czechia, and it did survive the trip.

#+END_EXPORT

The case and keycaps were quite good, however, the plate was rusty, and some of
the switches were scratchy.  It took a good bit of force to take apart the
switches from the plate too. Unfortunately, during that process, I scuffed a
couple of switch stems.

    <span class="img-description"> Tesla hall effect switches </span>
  </div>
#+END_EXPORT

I have planned to lube the switches and swap the rusty springs with the Cherry
ones. The plate needs to be sanded and repainted. This board uses a DB25
connector, so I need to find the pin layouts and make a converter for it.
