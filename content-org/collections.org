This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and care, it was up and running in a few hours.

I don't know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.

I got a Soarer's converter along with this keyboard. With a bit of remapping, I was able to replace it with my Drop CTRL as my new daily driver.

At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have
acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were
kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.

The board wasn't in a terrible condition when I got it. The foam had turned
into sticky goo, which needed some cleaning up. I manually cut a craft store
foam and replaced it.

The case needs powder-coating, and I only stripped it halfway. Not going to
lie; I do like how it looks now. In the future, I have plans to paint it either
olive-green or matte black.
