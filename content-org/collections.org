This is the first vintage keyboard I have acquired. Unfortunately, it was broken
into pieces on its way to me from Florida. However, with a bit of tender love and
care, it was up and running in a few hours.

I don't know the exact manufacturing date of the board, but there is a sticker
that says it was repaired in 1989. Most IBM 5150 keyboards were manufactured
before 1984, So it is at least 37 years old in 2021.

I got a Soarer's converter along with this keyboard. With a bit of remapping, I
was able to replace it with my Drop CTRL as my new daily driver.

At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have
acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were
kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.

The board wasn't in a terrible condition when I got it. The foam had turned
into sticky goo, which needed some cleaning up. I manually cut a craft store
foam and replaced it.

The case needs powder-coating, and I only stripped it halfway. Not going to
lie; I do like how it looks now. In the future, I have plans to paint it either
olive-green or matte black.

I got Pandrew's version of Xwhatsit controller and a solenoid driver to replace
the original controller. After a bit hacking around with qmk, I got it working.

*** History
This keyboard originally came with IBM Personal Computer AT (PC/AT). This
computer was released in 1984, and IBM has produced over 100,000 units before
discontinuing them in 1987. Some sources say that the *AT* stands for *Advanced Technology*.

    <span class="img-description"> IBM Model F AT key units </span>
  </div>
#+END_EXPORT

This model was a successor to the very famous and now weird XT layout. The IBM PS/2 (Personal System/2) was the successor to the IBM PC/AT, and with it came the venerable model M keyboard. The model M keyboard introduced the very layout that is being used worldwide even today.


*** Acquisition & Restoration

I have acquired this keyboard from eBay for a fair price. It was super dirty and was full of gunk. The barrel plate has rusty, and there were a bunch of dead spiders inside. The keycaps were quite filthy too.

The Foam was rotten and kept falling out the whole time. However, the back rainbow plate was pristine, and there weren't any rust spots on it.

    <span class="img-description"> Model F AT rainbow plate </span>
  </div>
#+END_EXPORT

I removed the caps and barrels and washed them in warm soapy water. Then scrubbed the barrel plate but couldn't repaint it because I ran out of spray paints by then. Replaced the rotten foam with a hand-made 2mm one, and reassembled everything.

  </div>
#+END_EXPORT

It was an absolute joy to use the keyboard on modern machines. It uses AT protocol, So using a passive AT to PS/2 converter would do the trick. Since I don't own a computer with a native PS/2 port, I daisy-chained an active PS/2 to USB (A) converter and then another Type A to Type C adapter to connect my Macbook Pro.
