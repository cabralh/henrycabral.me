** Status update #1 :log:

I have been spending so much time and energy tweaking this website, that I feel
like I should maintain a log for it. No Git commit messages are not enough anymore.
It's kinda fun owning a place on the internet but at the same time it should at
least mean something.

This update brings a list of logs where I will be writing more often now. Logs
will be mostly unimportant and personal(Not that personal).

Also It is a better place to write about personal experiences about non tech
stuff and I don't have to worry about too much for the content. I am having a thought
on writing political articles too. I seriously think the media in India is not
representing different angles to a problem. All I hear is only two sides
where as there could be thousands of views and perspectives to any problem.

I think I gotta give it a try, now that I can.

** Wrap up 2019 :log:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: wrap-up-2019

   :EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: aliases /log/wrap-up-2019
   :END:

Guess it's time to retrospect the last 12 months.

I will be talking about topics that I have worked on or learned. These
are listed in no particular order.

*** *Python*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: python
    :END:

In June I switched my job and accepted a position of a back-end
developer in a fairly new company with a brand new project. The tech
stack was python and angular. Even though Python was my first love, by
that time I was more of a JavaScript guy rather than a Pythonista.
Luckily I got more than enough support from my team to understand the
implemented code base and in no time I was comfortable enough finish
several Jira tasks.

I have learned Flask as it is the /de facto/ framework for all the
projects we have been building here. I couldn't help but notice how
similar it was to express.js, which in fact helped me accelerating my
learning.

Python is so straight forward and fun, sometimes I wonder why I left it
in the first place.

*** *React*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: react
    :END:

Even though I have been building React applications for more than two
years, This year, particularly the first half in
[[https://turbot.com][Turbot]] I got an opportunity to build/contribute
to a project which helped me understand the design patterns around a
front-end application, code-splitting, authorization, authentication and
much more.

*** *Touch typing*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: touch-typing
    :END:

This is something I am actually proud of.

Fortunately I was able to get a job that respects the work life balance
everybody should have. Ironically given the fact that I had little
difference between work and my life(my cat sighs ðŸ˜¾!), I chose to develop
some nerd powers that I have been dreaming to have for a long time.I
have always wanted to learn touch typing since I saw one of my
ex-colleague writing code at 80wpm.

I never actually got time to practice/focus on it until after June, when
I changed my job and joined the above mentioned company. The project was
in its infancy and all I had to do is write code without looking down at
my keyboard. I will admit, it was really tough to break an ancient
practice of peeking and typing until I replaced my keyboard keycaps with
blank ones.

Also [[https://10fastfingers.com/][10fastfingers.com]] and
[[https://www.typingclub.com/][typingclub]] were a great help in
practicing too.

*** *vi*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: vi
    :END:

This year was monumental for my personal vim experience.

My vim configuration got much matured. Coupling with touch-typing I
almost felt like a Wizard I always wanted to be. I even wrote some posts
on customizing vim for different purposes too.

Pretty good huh!

*** *epilogue*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: epilogue
    :END:

Honestly it was a pretty good year for me. A new job, new city and a
bunch of cool stuff to learn!

Hope Loki approves this post.

He got me this year too.
** Status update #2 :log:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: status-update-2
   :EXPORT_DATE: 2020-0l-31
   :EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: aliases /log/status-update-2
   :END:

Guess it's time for a status update.

2020 huh. Well as usual I don't have a resolution this year. My
resolution deadlines are quite small and always ends with utter
disappointment, so I better not mention it here.(recruiters ignore this)

  Let's get serious!

*** *New project*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: new-project
    :END:

In January, I started working on a project named *Solitude*. It's a note
taking application which is using GitHub as a CMS. It will create and
maintain a repository of notes and will sync them in real-time. The
design is inspired from [[https://utteranc.es/][utteranc.es]] which uses
GitHub issues to store blog comments. This website uses Utterances too.

Solitude aims to be a very opinionated and self-controlled note taking
application. Hence the contents of the solitude-maintained repository
should only be modified by the application in order to maintain a stable
state.

I am using React, Redux and GitHub's graphQL API to build this
application. Also using [[https://codemirror.net][Codemirror]] as the
note taking editor.

The hardest part building this application is to rememeber technologies
that I haven't used in almost an year.

New project ideas 1. A micro server to authenticate GitHub 2. Minimal
static site generator

I will be using python to build both the projects.

*** *New languages*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: new-languages
    :END:

I have been writting Javascript and Python for the pase 4 years and I
have always believed that these two are enough to satisfy all my needs
as web developer. Then I came accross a
[[https://youtu.be/OyfBQmvr2Hc][Talk]] and I decided that I gotta learn
LISP.

Also I am thinking to switching to Emacs. Already joined their camp on
reddit.

P.S: Unedited and raw stuff
** Switching to Emacs :log:emacs:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: switching-to-emacs
   :EXPORT_DATE: 2020-02-09
   :EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: aliases /log/switching-to-emacs
   :END:

I have spend enormous time on configuring and reconfiguring my vimrc
file for the past 4 years. I have been using (neo)vim at work for last 2
years and I am really happy how this has turned out. Now I am pretty
confident on most of the vim key-bindings, the register management and a
lot of other amazing features.

*Fuck it! I am switching to Emacs.*

** Nothing's wrong with reinventing the wheel :log:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: nothing-is-wrong-with-reinventing-the-wheel
   :EXPORT_DATE: 2020-04-05

   :END:

I have heard it many times and I have had enough.

Some devs(mostly junior) come up to me and ask what to build as a side
project and my answer always has been is to build something that you see
everyday and improve if possible. Then the next thing I get is "I wanna
build that but it already exists" or something like "Even if I build it
I can't show it on my resume because there is a better alternative."

IT DOESN'T MATTER.

If people stop doing things that are already done, there won't be any
Tour de France every year. No one would climb up Everest again. No
country would spend millions for a Man-on-Moon mission.

THIS IS JUST FULL BLOWN HYPOCRISY.

When a developer builds an Instagram clone, it's actually means that he
has single handedly created an application which was actually developed
by an army of engineers in the first place. It shows nothing but the
capability and understanding of the developer.

In fact once you build something like and Instagram clone, you would get
to know how real world projects actually work behind the scenes. You
could make some changes and take decisions that the original engineers
couldn't afford. That could even open up a possibility to improve some
skills in certain areas.

So bottom line is if you find any project that's fun, copy it, reverse
engineer it, go nuts and make it happen. There is nothing wrong with
reinventing the wheel.
