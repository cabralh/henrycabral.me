I write articles related but not exclusive to technical, professional, spiritual and medical. Non-exhaustive list of topics include:

* Product Management
* Personal Development
* Spirituality
* Biomechanics
* Active Lifestyle & Wellness

I also plan to document my projects in real-time along with still shots of my own liking coupled with book/journal article reviews of the various subjects listed above.

Currently I work as a development engineer in the healthcare space but consult part-time as a Content/Technical Writer & Product Engineer. Currently open to more contracts depending on project scope/timeline.

This will also serve as a live workspace for projects. Looking forward to learning and growing alongside you all!
