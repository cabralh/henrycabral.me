It was a hard decision.

I don't care who you are, where you leave or how many dogs you have. Be
assured that you won't be tracked once you leave my site.

All I care about is what you do while you are here. I am probably
watching your cursor moves as you are going close the tab. Good
decision.

P.S: I am not EVIL.
