At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have
acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were
kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.

The board wasn't in a terrible condition when I got it. The foam had turned
into sticky goo, which needed some cleaning up. I manually cut a craft store
foam and replaced it.

The case needs powder-coating, and I only stripped it halfway. Not going to
lie; I do like how it looks now. In the future, I have plans to paint it either
olive-green or matte black.
