At the time of writting, this old beamer is the prize of my collection. I have
acquired this from a DT member who let it go for a fair enough price. They were
kind enough to send me an metal(iron) door with the board too.

Initially, I liked the battered look of the board, but after a while, I powder
coated it to black. I couldn't find an "olive-green" or "matte-black" color,
So I settled for Glossy black. It looked quite good in person but shines a lot
on camera.

The board wasn't in a terrible condition when I got it. The foam had turned
into sticky goo, which needed some cleaning up. I manually cut a craft store
foam and replaced it.

I got Pandrew's version of Xwhatsit controller and a solenoid driver to replace
the original controller. After a bit hacking around with qmk, I got it working.
