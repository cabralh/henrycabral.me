So here I am, finally acknowledging an issue I am both suffering from and
enjoying. I own around 50 keyboards, most of them are vintage, and some of them
are modified to be used with modern computers. I am not a collector, nor
aspiring to be one. I have no reason to buy so many of them. I might be
suffering from Compulsive Buying Disorder, and the only time I stop is when I
run out of money.


## The Beginning {#the-beginning}

It all started 5 years ago, I was working for a start-up and was
typing(programming) a lot on a day-to-day basis. I thought of spending some
money on a good keyboard, Hence I got a CoolerMaster Masterkeys Pro L with
Cherry MX blue switches. It was amazing, I know everyone hates MX blues, but
back then it was a huge upgrade from the laptop keyboards. It was noisy enough
to annoy my colleagues, Anyways I didn't like my colleagues very much. :)

The next year I switched my job and moved to a different city. By then I have
started noticing that the MX blues aren't very good for gaming.=So I ordered
another keyboard for my home setup, It was a CoolerMaster MK 730. This time I
chose MX Brown, the most hated Cherry MX switch ever.

The next year I changed my job again, and the Pandemic started. I was bored with
the rattly MX blues and scratchy MX browns. I went ahead and ordered the Drop
Ctrl keyboard with Box white switches. I lived with that for six months before
I got tired and wanted to try something different.


## Vintage Boards {#vintage-boards}

It was about time when I wanted the most loved keyboard of all time, the IBM
Model M. I joined Deskthority, in search of a refurbished Model M, and found
out that there is a shitton of vintage boards out there. Soon I got two German
IBM M122s and one Model F XT. The Model F was in pieces when it reached here,
but I loved it to bits. It was clearly better than the Model M, and all other
keyboards I have tried before. And then in order to try more boards, I started
buying them, and soon I got 3 more Model Ms, some IBM num pads, a Model F AT,
and a Beamspring board. The Beamspring board is the most expensive keyboard I
own.

Then I started buying Alps boards, White, blues, and whatnot. I managed to get
into the Space Invader keyboard GB and bought 10 of them. I did buy some cheaper
modern custom keyboards here and there too. Buying from Different countries was
hard with the inflated shipping costs, and high customs duties. However, many
Deskthority members helped me store and ship the boards.

At the time of writing, I have around 50 boards in my closet and another 20
keyboards with my proxies in different countries.


## Modern Boards {#modern-boards}

After hanging out with Deskthority folks, I started disliking the modern
keyboards. The modern keyboards felt boring, monotonus, and without a character.
The issue with vintage keyboards is that these are big keyboards. I, on the
other hand like smaller ones on my desk. I couldn't get accustomed to large
boards on my desk for a longer period. However, I had snagged a Model F62 from
mechmarket a while back. It was perfect, with my favorite capacitive buckling
spring switches, It became my daily driver very quickly.


## The real problem {#the-real-problem}

So I do enjoy collecting keyboards and trying them. The real issue is I spend
too much money on acquiring them, and it's slowly hurting my financial
stability. It's pretty obvious, and the solution is to stop buying more
keyboards. Duh!

But it is harder than it seems, and that's why this is one of the deadliest
addictions in my life. The weird thing I notice is that I do enjoy owning
keyboards even though I don't use them. It's very unlike me Since I have always
gotten rid of things I don't have use of.

Involving in keyboard communities didn't help the case either. Rather collecting
and acquiring keyboards helped me get acknowledgments and boosted the hunger to
get more. Leaving those communities feels hard now Since I have made friends
there and don't want to leave.

For some time, I believed making more would help solve the problem like it
always has been. I was completely wrong, more money just made me more careless
with it. I kept buying pricier boards and didn't think even think about it.


## An interim solution {#an-interim-solution}

The good thing is I have now around 25 keyboards which don't work with modern
keyboards. I intend to focus on converting them to use with modern boards, and
documenting the process. Itâ€™s harder and a little less rewarding, but this seems
like something that I can concentrate my energy on.
