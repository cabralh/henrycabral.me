Guess it's time for a status update.

2020 huh. Well as usual I don't have a resolution this year. My
resolution deadlines are quite small and always ends with utter
disappointment, so I better not mention it here.(recruiters ignore this)

> Let's get serious!


## **New project** {#new-project}

In January, I started working on a project named **Solitude**. It's a note
taking application which is using GitHub as a CMS. It will create and
maintain a repository of notes and will sync them in real-time. The
design is inspired from [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/) which uses
GitHub issues to store blog comments. This website uses Utterances too.

Solitude aims to be a very opinionated and self-controlled note taking
application. Hence the contents of the solitude-maintained repository
should only be modified by the application in order to maintain a stable
state.

I am using React, Redux and GitHub's graphQL API to build this
application. Also using [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net) as the
note taking editor.

The hardest part building this application is to rememeber technologies
that I haven't used in almost an year.

New project ideas 1. A micro server to authenticate GitHub 2. Minimal
static site generator

I will be using python to build both the projects.


## **New languages** {#new-languages}

I have been writting Javascript and Python for the pase 4 years and I
have always believed that these two are enough to satisfy all my needs
as web developer. Then I came accross a
[Talk](https://youtu.be/OyfBQmvr2Hc) and I decided that I gotta learn
LISP.

Also I am thinking to switching to Emacs. Already joined their camp on
reddit.

P.S: Unedited and raw stuff
