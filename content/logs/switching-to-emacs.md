I have spend enormous time on configuring and reconfiguring my vimrc
file for the past 4 years. I have been using (neo)vim at work for last 2
years and I am really happy how this has turned out. Now I am pretty
confident on most of the vim key-bindings, the register management and a
lot of other amazing features.

**Fuck it! I am switching to Emacs.**
