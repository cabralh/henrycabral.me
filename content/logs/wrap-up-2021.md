I started this `logs` page to write frequently, but it is not going very well.
Here we go, yet another yearly log.


## New hobbies {#new-hobbies}

I started collecting vintage keyboards during the early months of last year. I
initially started with IBM boards due to my love for clicky switches. Then after
a while, I learned about hundreds of varieties of switches that were
manufactured in the last century, and obviously, I have started to collect them.

</div>

I have started a page to document most of them and learned to take better
pictures of my boards. Technically, I am now a tech hoarder.


## Loki {#loki}

Loki has been staying with my parents for the past two years and he is a happy
cat. He enjoys his mornings and evenings chasing butterflies in their garden and
sleeping all other time. I have stayed most part of the year with them and moved
to Bangalore in November.

When I went back to visit, he had almost forgotten me :(


## Epilogue {#epilogue}

Well, for me 2021 was a dull and quiet year, and I don't have many updates. With
the pandemic easing up, I am hoping to get more outdoor exposure in 2022 but it
seems like I couldn't care less about it anymore.
